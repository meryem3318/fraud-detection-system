# Fraud Detection and Comparison
## I trained and compared 3 models: Logictic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.
## Logistic Regression achieved the best recall, which means it catches the most frauds, but at the cost of false positives
## Random Forest prevents false alarms more effectively.
## Overall, XGBoost wins because it holds the best balance between catching fraud & not annoying users with false alarms
